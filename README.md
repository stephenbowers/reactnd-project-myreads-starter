# MyReads Project

This is a bookshelf app that tracks the books you are currently reading, books you want to read, and books you have already read.  It allows you to search for books, add them to your collection, and manage them.

## Requirements

To use the app, you only need a modern browser with an active Internet connection.

If you would like to install the app on your own system, just clone/download the repository, install all dependencies with `npm install`, and then start the development server with `npm start`
